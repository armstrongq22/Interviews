##946. Validate Stack Sequences

# Initial Approach
'''html
My first approach was to iterate through the popped array and check if the element had already been pushed,
if it had then I will simply compare the top of the stack to the popped array element. However, if it has not been pushed,
then I simply iterate through the pushed array until I add the element and then I pop it off the stack.
'''

'''java
class Solution {
    public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        Stack<Integer> stk = new Stack<>();
        
        int pushIdx = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < popped.length; i++) {
            if(stk.contains(popped[i])) {
                if(stk.pop() != popped[i]) return false; 
            }
            else {
                while(pushIdx < pushed.length && !stk.contains(popped[i])) {
                    stk.push(pushed[pushIdx]);
                    pushIdx++;
                }
                stk.pop();
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

# Approach 2
'''html
After going back over my initial solution I realized that I had some bottlenecks that were slowing my solution down.
If I could think of a way to eliminate .contains() then my solution could reach faster time complexities.
'''

'''java
class Solution {
    public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        Stack<Integer> stk = new Stack<>();
        int idx = 0;
        
        for(int x : pushed) {
            stk.push(x);
            while(!stk.empty() && stk.peek() == popped[idx]) {
                stk.pop();
                idx++;
            }
        }
        
        return stk.empty();
    }
}
'''

'''html
This solution simply pushes all of the element in the pushed array, and if at anytime it encounters the next element to be popped then it will pop it from the stack.
The time complexity will be linear O(n) because worst case it iterates through pushed and popped once. The space complexity will also be linear O(n) due its worst case
of storing every element in the pushed array.
